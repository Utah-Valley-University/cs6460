Project parameters for Pacman reinforcement learning.

This module defines configuration parameters for Project 3 which implements
reinforcement learning algorithms in the Pacman environment. It specifies
the student code files to be submitted, test classes, and project metadata.

Variables:
    STUDENT_CODE_DEFAULT: List of required student implementation files
    PROJECT_TEST_CLASSES: Test class module for autograding
    PROJECT_NAME: Name and number of this project
    BONUS_PIC: Flag for enabling bonus visualization
