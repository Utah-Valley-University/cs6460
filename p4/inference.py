Inference module for the Pacman game.

This module provides probabilistic inference capabilities for tracking
ghost positions in the Pacman game. Key components include:

1. DiscreteDistribution - Models belief distributions over discrete states
2. Inference algorithms for ghost position tracking
3. Particle filtering implementation
4. Exact inference using forward algorithm
5. Joint particle filtering for multiple ghosts

The module works with game.py and ghostAgents.py to enable probabilistic
reasoning about ghost locations based on noisy sensor readings.

Changes by George Rudolph 30 Nov 2024:
- Verified compatibility with Python 3.13
- Enhanced module documentation
- Added type hints throughout
- Improved class and method documentation
- Modernized DiscreteDistribution implementation
- Added input validation
